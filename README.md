***Questions***
What does the rails helper do!?

WHy do we put tests in the different files - reviews_helper_spec.rb?

When would we put a test in spec controller?

Spec --> models --> unit tests -->
          restaurant.reviews.create(rating: 3)
          restaurant.reviews.create(rating: 5)
          expect(restaurant.average_rating).to eq 4

Spec --> support --> leave_review = a method used in tests, not the applicaiton

db migrate, scheme & seeds

rails/rake?

config file
bin file

review feature spec --> visit restaurants_path(@honey)
